    "text": "The folders inside this folder should contain all data at various stages.\nThis data is being loaded/manipulated/changed/saved with code from the code folders.\nYou should place the raw data in the raw_data folder and not edit it. Ever!\nIdeally, load the raw data into R and do all changes there with code, so everything is automatically reproducible and documented.\nSometimes, you need to edit the files in the format you got. For instance, Excel files are sometimes so poorly formatted that it’s close to impossible to read them into R, or the persons you got the data from used color to code some information, which of course won’t import into R. In those cases, you might have to make modifications in a software other than R. If you need to make edits in whatever format you got the data (e.g. Excel), make a copy and place those copies in a separate folder, AND ONLY EDIT THOSE COPIES. Also, write down somewhere the edits you made.\nAdd as many sub-folders as suitable. If you only have a single processing step, one sub-folder for processed data is enough. If you have multiple stages of cleaning and processing, additional sub-folders might be useful. Adjust based on the complexity of your project.\nI suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data:\nhttp://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata"

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/yufeiwu/Desktop/STAT master/MADA/yufeiwu-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Many more style files for almost any journal are available. You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word references.bib but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better."

Those can be R or Quarto files. In either case, document the scripts and what goes on in them so well that someone else (including future you) can easily figure out what is happening.\nThe scripts should load the appropriate data (e.g. raw or processed), perform actions, and save results (e.g. processed data, figures, computed values) in the appropriate folders. Document somewhere what inputs each script takes and where output is placed.\nIf scripts need to be run in a specific order, document this. Either as comments in the script, or in a separate text file such as this readme file. Ideally of course in both locations.\nDepending on your specific project, you might want to have further folders/sub-folders."

    "text": "This Quarto file loads the cleaned data and does some exploring.\nI’m only showing it the way where the code is included in the file. As described in the processing_code materials, I currently prefer the approach of having R code in a separate file and pulling it in.\nBut I already had this written and haven’t yet re-done it that way. Feel free to redo and send a pull request on GitHub :)\nAgain, it is largely a matter of preference and what makes the most sense to decide if one wants to have code inside Quarto files, or as separate R files. And sometimes, an R script with enough comments is good enough and one doesn’t need a Quarto file.\nAlso note that while here I split cleaning and exploring, this is iterative. You saw that as part of the processing, we already had to explore the data somewhat to understand how to clean it. In general, as you explore, you’ll find things that need cleaning. As you clean, you can explore more. Therefore, at times it might make more sense to combine the cleaning and exploring code parts into a single R or Quarto file. Or split things in any other logical way.\nAs part of the exploratory analysis, you should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. Figures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data.\nStart by exploring one variable at a time. Then continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables.\nPlots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones.\n\nSetup\n\n#load needed packages. make sure they are installed.\nlibrary(here) #for data loading/saving\n\nhere() starts at /Users/yufeiwu/Desktop/STAT master/MADA/yufeiwu-MADA-portfolio\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\nlibrary(skimr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nLoad the data.\n\n#Path to data.

Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

Does that mean it should be a numeric 60? It somehow doesn’t make sense since the weight is 60kg, which can’t happen for a 60cm person (a baby). Since we don’t know how to fix this, we might decide to remove the person. This “sixty” entry also turned all Height entries into characters instead of numeric. That conversion to character also means that our summary function isn’t very meaningful. So let’s fix that first.\n\nd1 &lt;- rawdata %&gt;% dplyr::filter( Height != \"sixty\" ) %&gt;% \n                  dplyr::mutate(Height = as.numeric(Height))\nskimr::skim(d1)\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\nd1\n\n\nNumber of rows\n13\n\n\nNumber of columns\n5\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n2\n\n\nnumeric\n3\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nGender\n0\n1\n1\n2\n0\n5\n0\n\n\nEmployment Status\n0\n1\n1\n1\n0\n3\n0\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nHeight\n0\n1.00\n151.62\n46.46\n6\n154.00\n165\n175\n192\n▁▁▁▂▇\n\n\nWeight\n1\n0.92\n647.92\n2000.48\n45\n54.75\n73\n90\n7000\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nAge\n0\n1.00\n39.46\n17.89\n15\n25.00\n41\n50\n72\n▇▃▆▃▃\n\n\n\n\nhist(d1$Height)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we see that there is one person with a height of 6.

I suggest you save your processed and cleaned data as RDS or RDA/Rdata files. This preserves coding like factors, characters, numeric, etc. If you save as CSV, that information would get lost. However, CSV is better for sharing with others since it’s plain text. If you do CSV, you might want to write down somewhere what each variable is.\nSee here for some suggestions on how to store your processed data: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/saving-data-into-r-data-format-rds-and-rdata\n\nsave_data_location &lt;- here::here(\"starter-analysis-exercise\",\"data\",\"processed-data\",\"processeddata2.rds\")\nsaveRDS(processeddata2, file = save_data_location)\n\nNote the use of the here package and here command to specify a path relative to the main project directory, that is the folder that contains the .Rproj file. Always use this approach instead of hard-coding file paths that only exist on your computer.\n\n\nNotes\nRemoving anyone observation with “faulty” or missing data is one approach. It’s often not the best. based on your question and your analysis approach, you might want to do cleaning differently (e.g. keep observations with some missing information)."

This contains information on movie titles, release year, genre, and ratings (including user who rated the movie and a time stamp for the rating).\nHere’s a summary of the data structure and variables:\n\n#data structure and summary\nstr(movielens)\n\n'data.frame':   100004 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ movieId  : int  31 1029 1061 1129 1172 1263 1287 1293 1339 1343 ...\n $ title    : chr  \"Dangerous Minds\" \"Dumbo\" \"Sleepers\" \"Escape from New York\" ...\n $ year     : int  1995 1941 1996 1981 1989 1978 1959 1982 1992 1991 ...\n $ genres   : Factor w/ 901 levels \"(no genres listed)\",..: 762 510 899 120 762 836 81 762 844 899 ...\n $ userId   : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ rating   : num  2.5 3 3 2 4 2 2 2 3.5 2 ...\n $ timestamp: int  1260759144 1260759179 1260759182 1260759185 1260759205 1260759151 1260759187 1260759148 1260759125 1260759131 ...\n\nsummary(movielens)\n\n    movieId          title                year     \n Min.   :     1   Length:100004      Min.   :1902  \n 1st Qu.:  1028   Class :character   1st Qu.:1987  \n Median :  2406   Mode  :character   Median :1995  \n Mean   : 12549                      Mean   :1992  \n 3rd Qu.:  5418                      3rd Qu.:2001  \n Max.   :163949                      Max.   :2016  \n                                     NA's   :7     \n                  genres          userId        rating        timestamp        \n Drama               : 7757   Min.   :  1   Min.   :0.500   Min.   :7.897e+08  \n Comedy              : 6748   1st Qu.:182   1st Qu.:3.000   1st Qu.:9.658e+08  \n Comedy|Romance      : 3973   Median :367   Median :4.000   Median :1.110e+09  \n Drama|Romance       : 3462   Mean   :347   Mean   :3.544   Mean   :1.130e+09  \n Comedy|Drama        : 3272   3rd Qu.:520   3rd Qu.:4.000   3rd Qu.:1.296e+09  \n Comedy|Drama|Romance: 3204   Max.   :671   Max.   :5.000   Max.   :1.477e+09  \n (Other)             :71588                                                    \n\n\n\n\nData exploration\nI noticed in the summary above that genre appears to have many categories that overlap (e.g., a genre is listed as Comedy|Drama|Romance).\n\ngenre_options &lt;- movielens %&gt;%\n  group_by(genres) %&gt;%\n  summarize(n = n()) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(n))\ngenre_options\n\n# A tibble: 901 × 2\n   genres                               n\n   &lt;fct&gt;                            &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Drama                             7757\n 2 Comedy                            6748\n 3 Comedy|Romance                    3973\n 4 Drama|Romance                     3462\n 5 Comedy|Drama                      3272\n 6 Comedy|Drama|Romance              3204\n 7 Crime|Drama                       2367\n 8 Action|Adventure|Sci-Fi           2146\n 9 Action|Adventure|Sci-Fi|Thriller  1453\n10 Action|Crime|Thriller             1441\n# ℹ 891 more rows\n\n\nThere are approximately 900 different entries for genre, many of which include multiple genres. It is important to note that the genres always have a capitalized first letter and appear in alphabetical order (e.g., Crime|Drama|Film-Noir|Romance). I will need to get this variable into a usable format during the data cleaning process.\n\n\nData cleaning\nI’m interested in whether the mean movie rating has increased over time, especially as special effects have improved. Since this is particularly relevant for action movies, I’m interested in seeing if this association differs between action and romance movies (a genre where special effects don’t usually matter).\nAnother thing noticed during the data exploration was that this dataset spans from 1902 to 2016. The first use of computer animation in a movie didn’t occur until 1965, so I will also exclude movies prior to 1960.\nTo get the data into a usable format to answer these questions, I conducted the following steps:\n\nDropped unnecessary variables (title, userID, and timestamp)\nRemoved observations where the movie year as missing (i.e., NA)\nRemoved rows with a year prior to 1960\nCreate indicator variables for action movies and romance movies\nCreate a categorical year variable to represent decade the movie came out (for exploratory purposes)\n\n\n#Creating new, clean dataset classed movies from movielens\nmovies &lt;- movielens %&gt;% \n  #Removing unnecessary variables\n  select(movieId, year, genres, rating) %&gt;%\n  #Deleting rows missing year information\n  filter(!is.na(year)) %&gt;%\n  #Deleting rows with year &lt; 1960\n  filter(year &gt;= 1960) %&gt;%\n  #Creating action indicator variable, 1 if Action is in the genre list, 0 otherwise\n  mutate(action = if_else(grepl(\"Action\", genres), 1, 0)) %&gt;%\n  #Creating romance indicator variable, 1 if romance is in the genre list, 0 otherwise\n  mutate(romance = if_else(grepl(\"Romance\", genres), 1, 0)) %&gt;%\n  #Creating 4 level indicator that combines action and romance indicators\n  mutate(act_rom = if_else(action == 0 & romance ==0, 0, \n                           if_else(action == 1 & romance == 0, 1, \n                                   if_else(action == 0 & romance == 1, 2,\n                                           if_else(action == 1 & romance == 1, 3, NA))))) %&gt;%\n  #Creating categorical year variable grouped by decade\n  mutate(year_cat = case_when(year &lt; 1970 ~ 1,\n                              year &gt;= 1970 & year &lt; 1980 ~ 2,\n                              year &gt;= 1980 & year &lt; 1990 ~ 3,\n                              year &gt;= 1990 & year &lt; 2000 ~ 4,\n                              year &gt;= 2000 & year &lt; 2010 ~ 5,\n                              year &gt;= 2010 ~ 6))\n\n#Confirming structure and summary of the new dataset movies\nstr(movies)\n\n'data.frame':   94651 obs. of  8 variables:\n $ movieId : int  31 1061 1129 1172 1263 1293 1339 1343 1371 1405 ...\n $ year    : int  1995 1996 1981 1989 1978 1982 1992 1991 1979 1996 ...\n $ genres  : Factor w/ 901 levels \"(no genres listed)\",..: 762 899 120 762 836 762 844 899 485 359 ...\n $ rating  : num  2.5 3 2 4 2 2 3.5 2 2.5 1 ...\n $ action  : num  0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ romance : num  0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 ...\n $ act_rom : num  0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 ...\n $ year_cat: num  4 4 3 3 2 3 4 4 2 4 ...\n\nsummary(movies)\n\n    movieId            year                       genres          rating     \n Min.   :     1   Min.   :1960   Drama               : 7187   Min.   :0.500  \n 1st Qu.:  1073   1st Qu.:1989   Comedy              : 6621   1st Qu.:3.000  \n Median :  2471   Median :1996   Comedy|Romance      : 3761   Median :4.000  \n Mean   : 13017   Mean   :1994   Drama|Romance       : 3240   Mean   :3.523  \n 3rd Qu.:  5507   3rd Qu.:2001   Comedy|Drama        : 3197   3rd Qu.:4.000  \n Max.   :163949   Max.   :2016   Comedy|Drama|Romance: 3039   Max.   :5.000  \n                                 (Other)             :67606                  \n     action          romance          act_rom          year_cat    \n Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :0.0000   Min.   :1.000  \n 1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:0.0000   1st Qu.:3.000  \n Median :0.0000   Median :0.0000   Median :0.0000   Median :4.000  \n Mean   :0.2817   Mean   :0.1866   Mean   :0.6549   Mean   :3.984  \n 3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:0.0000   3rd Qu.:1.0000   3rd Qu.:5.000  \n Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :1.0000   Max.   :3.0000   Max.   :6.000  \n                                                                   \n\n\nNext I want to confirm that the new indicator variables appeared to work by spot checking the new dataset.\n\n#Rows with Action included in the genre all have a value of 1 for action and 0 if they do not have action in the genre.

Same goes for romance movies for the romance indicator. Movies not in these genres have a 0 for the respective indicator variable.\n\n\nExploratory figures\nThese figures are being used to explore the whether movie ratings have increased with increasing use of computer graphics. The first figure is a stacked bar chart with year on the x-axis and the proportion of each rating on the y-axis. Ratings are color coded. The second is a boxplot of ratings by decade of release. These are plotted using the data overall and by genre (action/romance). As a note, since these are meant to be exploratory, I did not make them “pretty” by adjusting labels or aesthetic features.\n\n#Figure 1: Stacked bar chart looking at proportion of each rating by year\nmovies_sorted &lt;- movies %&gt;% arrange(rating)\nggplot(movies_sorted, aes(x=year, y = rating, fill=factor(rating))) + geom_bar(position=\"fill\", stat=\"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Spectral\") +\n  labs(title = \"Proportion of each rating by year\", y=\"Proportion of each rating\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, it seems like the average movie rating is likely decreasing since the cumulative proportion of ratings 4-5 has decreased with time.\n\n#Creating boxing plot of median movie rating by decade - overall\nggplot(movies, aes(x=factor(year_cat), y=rating)) + geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title=\"Median rating by decade of release date (1=1960s, 6=2010s)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe median rating has also decreased somewhat over time. It also looks like ratings have become less varied (tighter IQR) with time.\nThe next set of figures are meant to be used to understand differences in the association between rating and year by genre (action vs romance).\n\n#Figure 2: Stacked bar chart looking at proportion of each rating by year for action movies and romance movies only\nmovies_sorted_act_rom &lt;- movies %&gt;% arrange(rating) %&gt;% filter(act_rom == 1 | act_rom ==2)\nggplot(movies_sorted_act_rom, aes(x=year, y = rating, fill=factor(rating))) + geom_bar(position=\"fill\", stat=\"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Spectral\") +\n  labs(title = \"Proportion of each rating by year\", y=\"Proportion of each rating\")+\n  facet_grid(~act_rom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere aren’t any particularly obvious patterns in ratings by movie type (action on the left, romance on the right).\n\n#Creating boxing plot of median movie rating by decade - by genre (action and romance)\nggplot(movies_sorted_act_rom, aes(x=factor(year_cat), y=rating)) + geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title=\"Median rating by decade of release date (panel 1 = action, panel 2 = romance) (1=1960s, 6=2010s)\")+\n  facet_grid(~act_rom)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the median (IQR) ratings are similar between the two genres.\n\n\nStatisical models\nTo test the first research question, I performed a simple linear regression of rating as the outcome and year as the predictor. As a note, rating is not continuous, it is ordinal. It wold be more appropriate to use a ordinal logistic regression, but I’m assuming this is outside the scope of this class and simple linear regression will be acceptable for demonstration purposes.\n\n#Simple linear regression model modeling rating by year\nmovies_model1 &lt;- lm(rating ~ year, movies)\n#Getting model results\nsummary(movies_model1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = rating ~ year, data = movies)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.3342 -0.5356  0.2291  0.5820  1.6725 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

This association was in the opposite direction than my hypothesis. Maybe as computer graphics were used more and more in movies, peoples’ expectations got higher and higher making it harder to get a high rating?\nTo look at the second question, I performed a multivariable linear regression with an interaction between year and my action/romance indicator. I also restricted the dataset to only movies who were either action or romance (movies that were both or neither were excluded).\n\n#Multivariable linear regression model modeling rating by year\nmovies_model2 &lt;- lm(rating ~ year + act_rom + act_rom:year, movies_sorted_act_rom)\n#Getting model results\nsummary(movies_model2)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = rating ~ year + act_rom + act_rom:year, data = movies_sorted_act_rom)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-3.2709 -0.5347  0.1652  0.6246  1.7666 \n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.

As expected, year had a stronger effect on action movies than romance movies (based on the estimates from the table above - effect of a 1 year increase on mean rating is -0.015 + 0.0049 = -0.0101 for action movies (coded as 1) and -0.015 + 2*0.0049 = -0.0052 for romance movies (coded as 2)).\n\n\nConclusions\nAverage movie ratings have decreased over time since computer graphics began being used in movies. This association is stornger for action movies than romance movies."
